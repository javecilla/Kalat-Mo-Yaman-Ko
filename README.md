# Kalat Mo Yaman Ko

I developed Kalat Mo, Yaman Ko, a community-driven digital platform designed to transform clutter into opportunities and strengthen local connections through sustainability.  

This platform empowers users to **share, give away, and repurpose pre-loved items**, aligning with the core principles of **Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle**. Beyond just item sharing, it’s a space built to promote **eco-conscious living** and foster a **collaborative community ecosystem**.

I was referred by my professor to join the project team as the **Frontend Developer**, where I handled the full front-end implementation—ensuring a clean, responsive, and accessible user interface. The platform also integrates an automated CI/CD pipeline for frictionless deployment and iteration.

## Key Features

#### **Community-Centered Experience**  
- **Item Sharing & Repurposing** – Users can give away or claim pre-loved items.  
- **Eco-Sustainability Focus** – Encourages reducing waste through community engagement.  
- **Intuitive Navigation** – Simple, guided flow for ease of use.  

#### **Frontend Development Excellence**  
- **Responsive Web Design** – Optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences.  
- **Lightweight & Fast UI** – Prioritizing performance and accessibility.  
- **Clean Visual Hierarchy** – Organized content that aligns with sustainability goals.

#### **CI/CD & Automation**  
- **GitHub Auto-Deployment** – Every push to the main branch triggers live updates.  
- **Continuous Integration** – Smooth release cycles for fast iteration.  
- **Scalable Codebase** – Structured for future feature rollouts.

This project reflects a **fusion of sustainable innovation and clean frontend engineering**—a platform built to inspire communities to **turn clutter into collective value**.
